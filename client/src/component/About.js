                            <p>H2H has been started in May 2021 with ongoing unprecedented pandemic Covid-19 , We felt the need that we
                            youth should also come forward and play our part to serve the nation.The idea of this initiative is set
                            forth by our head organizer and transform the idea into reality , along with the help of an extremely
            talented organizing team.</p>

            just in real world we are planning to build an ecosystem.</p>

                            <p>Before this website/app we were helping through social media only in parts of Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.But
                            after that we thought to connect the patient more widely in conclusion of which we started H2H initiative.
                            Through social media only we have saved more than 300+ lives and still counting . We have connected with
                            some popular local and reliable NGOs and Political support such as SonuSood organization and BJYM (Unit of
                            Indian Government ruling party)
            We are appreciated by the local Newspapers and organization too for our same work.</p>
